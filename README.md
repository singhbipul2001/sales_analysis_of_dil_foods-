##  Objectives Covered

###  1. Data Cleaning and Validation
- Checked for **missing values** and **duplicates**
- Ensured data types are appropriate
- Verified data consistency

###  2. Revenue Calculation
- Created a new column `total_price = quantity √ó price`
- Calculated **total revenue per product category**
- Visualized using **bar charts**

###  3. Customer Retention
- Identified **repeat customers** who placed more than 2 orders

###  4. Sales Trend Analysis
- Created a **monthly revenue trend** using time series plots

###  5. Top 5 Customers
- Identified top 5 customers by revenue
- Visualized using a **bar chart**

###  6. Category Performance
- Compared **total revenue** across product categories

###  7. Predictive Analysis (Bonus)
- Built a **Linear Regression model** using:
  - Features: `order date`, `product category`
  - Target: `total revenue`
- Evaluated model using **R¬≤ score**
